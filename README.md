# <p align="center">VChat</p>

A modern voice chat application. The application welcomes the user with the login screen. After a simple registration process, an empty "Home" screen shows up and lists previous chats. On the "Search" screen, it is possible to find other users and start a new chat with them.

Because of the purpose of the application, chat can be made between users only via voice. VChat provides eleven different sound effects to the users, so they can have fun while chatting with others.

With the power of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), VChat runs perfectly on both mobile operating systems. To be able to run this project after cloning this repository, you need to provide Firebase's [JSON](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation) files.

The project written solely in [Dart Language](https://dart.dev/).
